# Loan_prediction
Overview :
This dataset contains information on loan applicants and whether their loan application was approved or not. It is often used as a sample dataset for machine learning tasks, particularly classification analysis, to predict loan approval based on various applicant features.

Dataset Description :
The dataset comprises the following columns:
Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application.
Gender: Gender of the applicant.
Married: Marital status of the applicant.
Dependents: Number of dependents of the applicant.
Education: Education level of the applicant.
Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed or not.
ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.
CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant.
LoanAmount: Amount of loan applied for.
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.
Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (1: Good, 0: Bad).
Property_Area: Area where the property is located.
Loan_Status: Status of the loan application (Y: Approved, N: Not Approved).

Purpose :
The purpose of this dataset is to serve as a sample dataset for building and testing machine learning models, particularly classification models, to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. By analyzing this dataset, data scientists and machine learning practitioners can develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant characteristics.
